Camp Wabanna reserves the right to search any campers belongings and confiscate these items.<br />~All medications brought by the camper (prescription or over-the-counter) must be given to the camp nurse or appointed staff member at the time of check in. The camp nurse station stocks the most common medicines such as Tylenol and cold remedies, so it is unnecessary to bring them. All medications must be in the original container and include a Camp Wabanna medication card which includes clear and current directions.<br />~ I understand that it is the policy of Camp Wabanna not to release a camper to anyone other than the person designated at the beginning of camp. I recognize that certain hazards and dangers are inherent in camp events and programs. And particularly but not limited to, swimming, boating, field activities, ropes courses, team courses, tower climbing, water tubing, canoeing. I understand that adventure activities may expose my child to psychologically and physically stressful and challenging situations.<br />~I understand, too, that although the program has taken precautions to provide proper organization, supervision, instruction, and equipment for each activity, it is impossible for the program to guarantee absolute safety. I understand that my child shares responsibility for his/her safety and I have instructed my child in the importance of knowing and abiding by the camp rules, regulations, and procedures for his/ her safety of camp participants. Camp Wabanna reserves the right to discipline or send home any child for any reason in its sole discretion. General reasons for immediate dismissal include, but are not limited to any of the following: if a health situation puts another individual in jeopardy, if the camper needs special health attention, if a child has a temperature above 101 degrees, pink eye, ring worm, lice, strep throat, or any infectious situation; or if a child is defiant, uncooperative, and will not or cannot participate in the normal program. Campers sent home due to behavioral problems are not allowed to return. Campers sent home due to medical reasons can only return to camp with a doctorâ€™s release and must be able to participate in the normal camp program. No refund will be given if a child is sent home for either behavioral or medical reasons.<br />~ If a departure need arises, parents/guardians or emergency contacts will be notified. Upon notification, the parent/guardian will be allowed a maximum time of four hours to remove their child from camp property.<br />~In signing this document, I hereby certify that the above information is correct, and I give permission for the use of photographs, or other media, including my son or daughter to be used in camp publicity.</div>
